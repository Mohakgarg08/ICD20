## Plotting a Function
  Introduction: Briefly introduce your project. Explain what it does, its purpose, and why it’s useful. This section should give readers a high-level overview.
  Installation: Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project. Include any dependencies or prerequisites needed for successful installation.
  
  
  ####My project is grphin an expresion in the form of a(bx-h)+k. Samples of this can be sin(x), 2sin(4 x -5)+8, sin(x-5), sin(x)-5, and etc. it can can be sin, cos or tan. This can help graph expressions. 
  
  
  
  Usage: Describe how to use your project. Highlight important features, commands, or functionalities. A usage overview helps users quickly understand how to execute your project.
  
  steps to to graph the expression
    1. After running the code
    2. It will ask for your favourite clor that is just the color of the graph.
    3. then it will ask for the expression to graph
    4. After entering it it will showcase the graph of the function you inputed.
  
  Documentation: If your project has additional documentation (such as API endpoints, configuration details, or examples), link to it here. Clear documentation makes it easier for others to contribute or collaborate.
  Contributing: Encourage collaboration by explaining how others can contribute to your project. Mention guidelines for submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and following coding standards.
  Credits and Appreciation: Acknowledge any external libraries, tools, or contributors who have influenced or contributed to your project. Gratitude goes a long way!
