#### How the Program Works
##### Importing Libraries
``` python
import math
import cmath
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This Snippet of code is used to import libraries that will be used in the program. 

##### Basic Calculator
 ```python
 # This function is for the basic calculator
def basic():
  # This functions is for calculating basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power
  def calculation():
    while True:
      try:
        print("symbols: Add(+), Subtract(-), Multiply(*), Divide(/), Power(**) ")
        solve= input("Enter The Expression. This is an example sample is (10+20/5*4**2) ")
        print(f"{solve} = {eval(solve)}")
        break
      except:
        print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
 ```
 This snippet of code is defining the function for the basic calculations. **``def basic():``** This line of code is defining a function called **``basic``** which will consist of two functions inside of it **``calculation``** and **``operation``**. **``def calculation():``** This line of code is defining a function called ``calculation`` which is inside of the ``basic function``. This functions is for ``calculating basic calculations`` ``such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power``. **``solve= input("Enter The Expression")``**. A sample of this is ``(10+20/5*4**2)``. This line of code is asking the user for what they what to calculate. **``print(f"{solve} = {eval(solve)}")``**. This line is solving the given calculation by the user, using ``{eval(solve)}``. The print statement is printing the answer to the users input. **``print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")``**. This line tells the user if its input is invalid and the **``while True:``**, **``try``** and **``except``** line helps the user enter the input again. 
 

``` python
def operation():
  def sin(x):
    return math.sin(x)
  def cos(x):
    return math.cos(x)
  def tan(x):
    return math.tan(x)
  def log(x):
    return math.log(x)
  def exp(x):
    return math.exp(x)
  def sqrt(x):
    return math.sqrt(x)
``` 
This snippet of code is defining functions for the different mathematical operations. **``def operation():``** This function is for mathematical operations such as sin, cos, tan, log, exp, sqrt For Example **``def sin(x): return math.sin(x)``** These two lines of code is defining the defining the ``sin`` function ``return math.sin(x)`` the x is the number provided by the user and ``math.sin`` is a function that sin of an given number.

```python
    while True:
      op= input("What operation do you want to do (Square Root= sqrt, Sin = S, Cos = C,Tan = T, Log = L, Exponential = E: ) ").lower()
      inputs=["sqrt", "s","c","t","l","e"]

      if op in inputs:

        # For Sin, Cos, Tan, Log, Exp, sqrt
        while True:
          try:
            user = float(input("Give me the number: "))
            if op == "s":
              print(f"The sin of {user} = {sin(user)}")
              break
            elif op =="c":
              print(f"The cos of {user} = {cos(user)}")
              break
            elif op =="t":
              print(f"The tan of {user} = {tan(user)}")
              break
            elif op=="l":
              print(f"The log of {user} = {log(user)}")
              break
            elif op=="sqrt":
              print(f"The Square Root of {user} = {sqrt(user)}")
              break
            elif op=="e":
              print(f"The exponential of {user} = {exp(user)}")
              break
            else:
              print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
          except:
            print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
        else:
          print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
        break
```
  **``user = float(input("Give me the number: "))``**. This line is asking the user for the number, they want to solve.  according to their chosen mathematical operation. This snippet of code is solving and retuning answer for that mathematical operation. For example if the user's choice was **``sin``** the user will enter **``s``**. It will verify if ``s`` is a valid input. Then the program will ask for the number you want to solve for. After, providing it the number it will go the the correct path for that function and execute it and return the value to the user. 

```python
while True:
    user= input("Do you want to do (basic calculation(1)) or (mathematical functions(2))  ")
    if user=="1":
      calculation()
      break
    elif user == "2":
      operation()
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
```
This snippet of code is asking the user to enter what they want to do basic calculation or mathematical operation. After, the program will jump to the function coreesponding to their input.
   
##### Area
```python
# This function is for solving the area
def area():
  # This function is for asking the user for the dimensions of that shape. This is for the shapes that have one input
  def oneinput(s):
    while True:
      try:
        return float(input(f"Enter the {s}"))
      except:
        print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
  # This function is for asking the user for the dimensions of that shape. This is for the shapes that have two inputs
  def twoinputs(s1,s2):
    return (oneinput(s1),oneinput(s2))

  # Area of rectangle
  def rectangle(l,w):
    return (l*w)
  # Area of square
  def square(l):
    return (l**2)

  # area of a triangle
  def triangle(b,h):
   return(b*h/2)

  # area of circle
  def circle(r):
    pi = math.pi
    return(pi*r**2)
```
This snippet of code is the function for area. **``def oneinput(s):``** This function is asking the user for the dimension of the shape. **`` def twoinputs(s1,s2):``** This function is also asking them for the demsinsion for the shape. There are two functions because some shapes require one or two dimensions to solve for the area. After the user has entered the dimension(s), then it will solve and return the area of that specific shape the user asked for. 

```python
 while True:
    choice=input("What do you want to find the area of (rectangle(1), square(2), triangle(3), circle(4)) ").lower()

    if choice== "2":
      l=oneinput("length")
      a= square(l)
      print(f"The area of the square with the length {l}= {a}")
      break
    elif choice=="1":
      sides=twoinputs("length","width")
      a= rectangle(sides[0],sides[1])
      print (f"The area of the rectangle with the length {sides[0]}and width {sides[1]} = {a}")
      break
    elif choice=="3":
      sides=twoinputs("base","heights")
      a=triangle(sides[0],sides[1])
      print (f"The area of the triangle with the base {sides[0]}and hight {sides[1]} = {a}")
      break
    elif choice== "4":
      r=oneinput("Radius")
      a=circle(r)
      print (f"The area of the circle with the radius {r}= {a}")
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid Input Please Try Again ")
```

This snippet of code is asking the user what shape they want to find the area of. Then, it gets the dimensions of the shape from the user. After, it uses the functions given above to compute and return the area of the given shape.

```python
# This function is for the graphing calculator
def graphing():
  # This function is for graphing polynomials and also an optional linear line if the user has one
  def polynomial():
  # will make the user enter the expression again if it is invalid
    while True:
      try:
        #asking the user for the expression
        equation=input("Enter the expression in the form of (3*x**2 + 4*x + 6) (two * for power and one for multiply) ")

        # This is generating the x values
        x= np.linspace(-10,10,400)

        # evaluating the expression
        y= eval(equation)

        user= input("Do you have a linear expression ")

           # evaluating the linear expression
        if user=="yes":
          linear= input("Enter the linear expression. sample of this is (3*x+2) ")
          y2=eval(linear)
          plt.plot(x,y2)

        #plotting the function
        plt.title(equation)
        plt.xlabel("x")
        plt.ylabel("y")
        plt.grid(True)
        plt.plot(x,y)
        break
      except (ValueError,NameError,ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError, SyntaxError):
        print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
        plt.clf()
```
This snippet of code is asking the user for the **polynomial expression** they want to graph. Then, it asks the user if they have a **linear expression** to graph as well. If **``yes``**, then it will ask the for the **linear expression** and graph both. Otherwise, it will graph the polynomial by it self. 

##### Trignometry 
```python
def trignometry():
    # This is the color for the graph/ User input for favorite color
    color = input("What is your favorite color? ").replace(" ", "")

    while True:
        # User input for expression
        expression = input("What is the expression? Sample of this is (2sin(4 x -5)+8) ").split("(")

        try:
          # Extracting coefficient from the expression
            first = expression
            second = expression[1].split(")")
            third = second[0].split("x")
            first.remove(first[1])
            second.remove(second[0])
          # Trigonometry function
            function = first[0][-3:]

            # a
            a = first[0][:-3]
            if a == "":
                a = 1
            a = float(a)

            # k
            k = second[0]
            if k == "":
                k = 0
            k = float(k)

            # h
            h = third[1]
            if h == "":
                h = 0
            h = float(h)

            # b
            b = third[0]
            if b == "":
                b = 1
            b = float(b)
            break
        except:
            print("Cannot Graph Please Try Again")

    # Generate x values
    x = np.arange(0, 6 * np.pi, 0.1)

    # Calculate y values based on the selected function
    if function == "sin":
        y1 = a * np.sin(b * x - h) + k
    elif function == "cos":
        y1 = a * np.cos(b * x - h) + k
    elif function == "tan":
        y1 = a * np.tan(b * x - h) + k
        y1[:-1][np.diff(y1) < 0] = np.nan

    # Create the plot
    try:
        fig = plt.figure()
        ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
        # Move left y-axis and bottom x-axis to center, passing through (0,0)
        ax.spines['left'].set_position('center')
        ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('center')
        plt.plot(x, y1,color=color)

    except ValueError:

        print(f"The color {color} is not available. Defaulting to BLUE.")
        plt.plot(x, y1, color="blue")

    plt.ylim(k - a, k + a)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.legend([function.capitalize()],loc='upper right')
    plt.xlabel("x",loc="left")
    plt.ylabel("y",loc="bottom")
    plt.title(f"{function.capitalize()}(x)")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```
This snippet of code is graphing **trigonometric expressions**. First, it asks the user for the **trigonometric expression**. Then, it extracts the coefficients from the user's given expression, which it then uses to graph the function according to the user's expression.

```python
 while True:
    user= input("What do want to do (1 for polynomial graph) (2 for trig graph)")
    if user=="1":
      polynomial()
      break
    elif user=="2":
      trignometry()
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid Input Please Try Again")
```
This snippet of code is asking the user what they want to graph; **polynomials** or  **trigonometric expressions**. Then, it jumps to the coressponding function.

##### Main Menu
```python
def main():

  while True:
    print("Enter (1) for Basic Calculations")
    print("Enter (2) for finding the area")
    print("Enter (3) for Graphing Calculator")

    calculator=input("What do you want to do? ")

    if calculator== "1":
      basic()
      break
    elif calculator=="2":
      area()
      break
    elif calculator=="3":
      graphing()
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid Input Please Try Agian")

main()
```
This snippet of code is the start of the program after running the program. This snippet of code is asking the user what they want to do; **Basic Calculator**, **area calculator**, or **Graphing Calculator**. Acordin to the user choice it will jump to that
